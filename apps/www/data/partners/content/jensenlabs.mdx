## How we use Supabase

In software development, you rarely get technologies that are both simple and powerful, and
Supabase is just that. It's embedded within our technology stack, serving as an
indispensable tool. From leveraging Postgres tables to manage complex data, employing
storage buckets for efficient file handling, to streamlining user authentication, Supabase's
suite of capabilities addresses our diverse needs, thus enhancing our services.

Project inception often begins with a fundamental question: "How can Supabase make our
clients' lives easier?" This reflects our commitment to deploying Supabase's strengths for
better client-focused outcomes. It improves reliability, as thereâ€™s an army of open source
contributors working on the project, while also speeding up our development process
dramatically. Clients love both of these things.

In a nutshell, our use of Supabase is driven by a commitment to efficiency, scalability, and
client satisfaction. It's this partnership that enables us to deliver superior, robust solutions
across various projects, ultimately enhancing the client experience.

## Our Ideal Supabase Project

Our ideal project is one where the client is genuinely driven to innovate and build something
exciting. Often this takes the form of an enterprise client who wishes to modernise the way they deal with data, and other times it takes the form of a well-funded startup looking to build
something that has never been done before. We can work with both, and have a special
affinity for startups, as our team are also founders :).

Voltapp is a revolutionary nocode tool to create any kind of application for desktop or mobile. Voltapp’s combinable bricks of codes come with a branching tree that serves as a visual (no)coding system that is intuitive while giving creators full control of the app without the limitations of other available nocode tools.

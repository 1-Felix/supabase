Build custom business apps and front-ends for your external or internal users! 

Jet Admin pairs really well with Supabase, providing a scalable, easy-to-build front-end for your Supabase instance. The building process is simple so even non-technical team members can build complex use-cases: just drag-and-drop and point-and-click, no curly braces needed.

With Jet you can:
* Have a simple CRUD app auto-generated on top of your data in a minute
* Build complex, multi-page apps without code
* Consolidate data from different data sources (join with SQL or through lookup/rollups)
* Write JS, HTTP, SQL, and embed custom components when needed, and more

### SMBs and Enterprise

We help SMBs and Enterprises optimize their workflows by developing custom business applications.

### How we use Supabase

Supabase gives us the best of both worlds. On the one hand, it allows us to be super fast with our development process, while on the other hand, it allows us to build for scale.

We love Supabase because:

- **Super fast development process** - we use Supabase to double-down on developing solutions in a matter of weeks, not months;
- **Security** - utilizing security features like User auth and Row-level security allows us to develop secure solutions for our customers:
- **Super admin console** - the possibility to manage users, data and storage directly in the Supabase console, eliminates the need to build separate Super Admin panels and thus reduces development time;
- **Ease of integration** - the one thing we love about Supabase is the ease of integration of Supabase to other development tools like WeWeb and FlutterFlow.

Overall, we always utilize everything that Supabase has to offer to eliminate the need for 3rd party solutions for easier long-term app management and scalability.

### Our ideal Supabase project

We love working on challenging projects with real-life impact - everything from business applications to optimizing business processes to world-changing startup projects. The thrill of creating something from scratch and that might change the way people live and work is what drives our team on a daily basis.

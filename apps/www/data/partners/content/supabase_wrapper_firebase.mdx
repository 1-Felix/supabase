[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is an app development platform built around non-relational technologies. The Firebase Wrapper supports connecting to below objects.

1. [Authentication Users](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/users) (_read only_)
2. [Firestore Database Documents](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) (_read only_)

## Preparation

Before you get started, make sure the `wrappers` extension is installed on your database:

```sql
create extension if not exists wrappers with schema extensions;
```

and then create the foreign data wrapper:

```sql
create foreign data wrapper firebase_wrapper
  handler firebase_fdw_handler
  validator firebase_fdw_validator;
```

### Secure your credentials (optional)

By default, Postgres stores FDW credentials inide `pg_catalog.pg_foreign_server` in plain text. Anyone with access to this table will be able to view these credentials. Wrappers is designed to work with [Vault](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/vault), which provides an additional level of security for storing credentials. We recommend using Vault to store your credentials.

```sql
-- Save your Firebase credentials in Vault and retrieve the `key_id`
insert into vault.secrets
  (name, secret)
values
  (
    'firebase',
    '{
      "type": "service_account",
      "project_id": "your_gcp_project_id",
      ...
  }'
  )
returning key_id;
```

### Connecting to Firebase

We need to provide Postgres with the credentials to connect to Firebase, and any additional options. We can do this using the `create server` command:

With Vault:

    ```sql
    create server firebase_server
      foreign data wrapper firebase_wrapper
      options (
        sa_key_id '<key_ID>', -- The Key ID from above.
        project_id '<firebase_project_id>'
    );
    ```

Without Vault:

    ```sql
    create server firebase_server
      foreign data wrapper firebase_wrapper
       options (
         sa_key '
         {
            "type": "service_account",
            "project_id": "your_gcp_project_id",
            ...
         }
        ',
         project_id 'firebase_project_id'
       );
    ```

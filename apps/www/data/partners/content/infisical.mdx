Infisical is an open-source end-to-end encrypted platform that lets developers manage application secrets across their team and infrastructure. 

The Supabase integration is useful if your Supabase project uses sensitive-information such as environment variables in edge functions.

Synced envars can be accessed in edge functions using Denoâ€™s built-in handler: `Deno.env.get(MY_SECRET_NAME)`.

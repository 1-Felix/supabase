## How we use Supabase

Most web applications provide features tailored to users that are protected by a signup/login flow. This could be through an email and password, magic link, or Single Sign-On (SSO).

Our tool of choice to easily implement any authentication and user management flow is Supabase.

We use Supabase because it allows us to deliver user-friendly and secure authentication flows. We can do that because Supabase provides built-in APIs and JavaScript libraries to implement and fully customize any protected backend.

It also deploys a Postgres database by default in the cloud that is protected against DDOS attacks, so we can just focus on implementing features.

## Our Ideal Supabase Project

We like to work with companies who are eager to grow and use the latest technologies to make their product faster and easier to manage.

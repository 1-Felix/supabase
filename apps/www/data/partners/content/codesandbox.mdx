The new [CodeSandbox Projects Beta](https://projects.codesandbox.io/) let’s you run your projects and turn them into a link you can share with anyone. Developers visiting your link can not only see your running code, they can click “fork” and get an exact copy of that environment so they can easily contribute back to your masterpiece. CodeSandbox integrates directly with GitHub, so you get a unique development environment for every PR you and your contributors open!

You can do all of this from a web browser, from [within VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeSandbox-io.codesandbox-projects), or via the [native iPad app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/codesandbox/id1423330822)!

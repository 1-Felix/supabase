The background jobs framework. Create long-running Jobs directly in your codebase with features like API integrations, webhooks, scheduling and delays.

Trigger anything from a database change. Keep your app, database and services in sync using Trigger.dev and create your Jobs where you're used to, in your own codebase.

Create Jobs with any service you use. Use our pre-built integrations or wrap any code in `io.runTask` to make it resumable and appear in the dashboard logs. You can also easily subscribe to webhooks and perform actions.

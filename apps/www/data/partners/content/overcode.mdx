## How we use Supabase

Here are the key reasons why we add Supabase to our technology stack when we start the new project development from scratch:

- **Database as a Service**: Supabase offers a fully managed, scalable PostgreSQL database as a service. This means that we can focus on building your application's features without worrying about database maintenance, backups, or infrastructure management.
- **Real-Time Capabilities**: Supabase provides real-time functionality out of the box, making it easy to create dynamic, collaborative applications. This feature is particularly useful for applications that require instant updates, such as chat apps, collaborative document editing, or live dashboards.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Supabase includes robust authentication and authorization features. We can easily implement user registration, login, and access control for your application, ensuring that your data remains secure.
- **RESTful APIs**: Supabase automatically generates RESTful APIs for database tables, making it simple to create, read, update, and delete data. This saves us time and effort in building custom APIs.
- **Serverless Functions**: Supabase allows us to write serverless functions using JavaScript or TypeScript. We can use these functions to create custom business logic or integrate with external services, all within the Supabase ecosystem.
- **High Performance**: Supabase is designed for high performance, with features like query caching and automatic indexing to ensure that our client’s product runs smoothly even as the app’s dataset grows.
- **Scalability**: Supabase scales with an application's needs, providing the infrastructure and resources necessary to handle increased traffic and data volume.
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Supabase seamlessly integrates with our core stack(React.js and Next.js), enhancing our development workflow.

## Our Ideal Supabase Project

We have two ideal project types:

- Our team provides app creation starting from research on tech stack and custom designs, and finishing with full-cycle development using Supabase as a backend solution.
- We provide you with our talented specialist(s) who will focus on tasks that you define. Scale team with pleasure through collaborating with us on an existing product’s development.

The majority of our clients are headquartered in the UK, US, or Israel, and they are typically supported by VC funding or have achieved profitability. We like ambitious firms who are reshaping their industries and are enthusiastic about embracing cutting-edge technologies.

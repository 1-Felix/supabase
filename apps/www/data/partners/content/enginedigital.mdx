## How we use Supabase

When building your project we will use Supabase to make sure you can scale and maintain all operations regardless of the traffic to your site or app. Using Supabase means that you will have great performance and excellent response times even as your database grows.

Choosing Supabase for your backend means we can reduce the number of services being used in your project. This allows you to maximise the development resources required to deliver the features you will need to make your app successful.

Using the realtime features of Supabase means we can design and build advanced interfaces that react to the changes in data. This allows your users and customers to receive live updates as changes are made within your application.

The flexible pricing means you can make predictable estimates and know that even in spikes or high usage moments you will not be surprised with a giant invoice. With various instance options we can resize your instance to make sure you aren't paying for resources that you aren't using.

## Featured Project

Check out our spotlight project, [ReviveRatings](https://www.reviveratings.com/), a multi-tenant reputation management platform that has helped 400 businesses collect thousands of reviews from their customers. This platform utilizes many great features from Supabase like PostgreSQL Row-level Security & Triggers.

## Services

Whether consulting or implementation, we offer a comprehensive range of custom software services.

### Migrating from Firebase to Supabase

We offer expert consulting and hands-on implementation services for migrating from Firebase to Supabase. While the two platforms share many features, there are key differences to keep in mind:

- Supabase operates on a Postgres (SQL) Database, while Firebase relies on NoSQL.
- As an open-source platform, Supabase allows for local operation, offering a significant edge over Firebase’s emulators.
- In terms of database security, Supabase incorporates Postgres Row-Level Security (RLS), in contrast with Firebase's Firebase Rules.

Migrating between these two platforms isn’t always clear-cut! Having helped many make the switch, we're equipped to help you enjoy the full suite of Supabase benefits while preserving your existing architecture.

### Multitenancy App Design

We also specialize in constructing applications designed for multitenancy, where individual customers can have their own, separate instances. Postgres's Row-Level Security (RLS) feature greatly enhances the efficiency and security of this approach, making Supabase a great platform for these types of applications.

## How we use Supabase

At Uncommon Purpose, we're big fans of Supabase. We use it for two key reasons: development speed and scalability.

Using Supabase on new projects accelerates development and provides basic functionality out of the box. Supabase saves time and reduces risk by offering built-in tools for all the common components of modern web-based systems. With Supabase, we can quickly create a solid foundation for a new project, allowing us to focus on the unique needs of our clients and allowing them to validate their ideas as quickly as possible.

For projects with systems already in place, Supabase's tried and tested open source components make it easy to integrate with other services or platforms as necessary. Whether it's a small feature enhancement or a complete overhaul of a legacy system, we can leverage as much or as little as the project needs without requiring a complete replatform.

## Our Ideal Supabase Project

We’d love to help you validate your early-stage idea and get your product to market quickly. We'll work with you to design and develop an MVP using Supabase, allowing you to test the waters and get feedback from users without committing a lot of time and resources.

On the other hand, we've also worked with large enterprises that need to make the most of opportunities faster than their legacy systems will allow. Supabase is the perfect tool for this, allowing us to quickly build out new infrastructure without sacrificing development efficiency or scalability.

In short, we're always purposeful, never common. We bring uncommon thinking to everything we do, and we'd love to bring it to your Supabase project.

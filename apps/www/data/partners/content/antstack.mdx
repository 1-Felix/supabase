## How we use Supabase

As an engineering-driven and technology-first company, we are always looking for new platforms and tools that help in building solutions for us and our customers. As part of the exploration, we built our first SaaS product on Supabase, and depending on how it scales for us, we intend to propose using Supabase for more and more customers in the future.

Being able to set up relational tables and having all the APIs, Authentication, and Authorization to the go aligns with our motto of simplifying technology.

## Our Ideal Supabase Project

Our ideal customer is someone who is looking to get their idea validated with an MVP within the span of a few months or who is looking for expertise on new and cutting-edge technologies. We take up projects that typically go from 3-12 months on a retainer basis. We help the customers from ideation (requirement analysis, discovery, design, mockups) to architecture, development, and delivery.
